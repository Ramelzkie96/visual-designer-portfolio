### What I learned

Throughout the development of this portfolio project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in several key areas:

1. Responsive Web Design: Learned how to structure and style layouts that adapt across various screen sizes using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries.
2. CSS Variables: Utilized :root custom properties to maintain a consistent color scheme and font weights, improving maintainability and scalability.
3. Typography and Fonts: Integrated Google Fonts (Epilogue and Jost) and practiced applying appropriate font weights and spacing for better readability and aesthetics.
4. Component-Based Layouts: Broke down sections (Hero, Skills, Work, Testimonials, Contact) into clear, reusable patterns, improving design clarity and development speed.
5. Clean Code Practices: Focused on organizing styles logically, reducing redundancy, and following modern best practices for naming and structure.
6. Mobile-First Thinking: Designed with responsiveness in mind from the start, ensuring the site looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
7. User Interface (UI) Design: Improved my understanding of spacing, visual hierarchy, and layout alignment to create a visually pleasing and accessible experience.
